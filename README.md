# About This Project

I created this project to begin play more with Rails and to finally use Twilio. The full tutorial can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-chat-ruby-on-rails-applications

In this tutorial, I learned how to build a live chat application using Twilio Programmable Chat and Ruby on Rails.

I also used bourbon and bitters for styling, clearance for authentication, and 
twilio-ruby to generate a token.
